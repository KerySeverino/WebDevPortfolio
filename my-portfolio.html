                Hello everyone! <br><br>
                I’m <b>Kery Severino Diaz</b>, originally from the Dominican Republic, and now proud to call New York City my home. While New York wasn’t exactly what I had envisioned, it’s a place where dreams can come true for those who are willing to put in the hard work and determination – and that’s exactly what I’m planning to do. <br><br>
                My passion is to make a positive impact on people’s lives. Whether through volunteering, mentoring, or simply offering a helping hand, I find immense joy in supporting others and making a meaningful difference. <br><br>
                There’s something incredibly fulfilling about witnessing someone succeed or conquer challenges with a little guidance and support. Through this website, I aim to share my experiences and resources to inspire and empower others on their journeys. Thank you for joining me on this path! <br><br>

                <b>How Everything Started:</b> <br><br>
                My passion for coding began when I was young. Growing up in the Dominican Republic, I often used my mom’s computer for gaming, sparking my love for technology. Whether it was fixing tech issues or assembling furniture, I enjoyed helping others. <br><br>
                Upon moving to New York, my passion continued. In high school, I took computer science and robotics classes, which deepened my interest. These classes introduced me to programming and the competitive nature of the field. Now, in college, I’m pursuing my dream of making a positive impact through technology and cats! <br><br>
