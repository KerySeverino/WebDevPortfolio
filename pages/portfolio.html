                    This website is my <b> WebDevPortfolio! </b> It stores videos of all my projects that I consider really well done.
                    I record them and display them here on this live website. This website is being created by me;
                    I'm learning as I go and adding new features to it, so it should be a bigger project than it is now.
                    I'm planning to add more features beyond  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the future as well. As of now, I think it works well.
                    The code for this website is on GitHub. It is being run as a GitHub Page with a custom domain. 
                    You can find instructions on how to set it up on GitHub. I only bought the domain and linked it to everything based on the instructions.

                    How it started: A game idea based on Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf.
                    At first, I didn't know what to do; I had a lot of ideas and was switching game themes frequently. 
                    Initially, I was working on a wizard game, but it didn't stick with me. After discussing with friends and seeing their positive reactions, I decided to switch the characters.
                    They loved it! Their encouragement motivated me to keep working on this.

                    How it started: My second Python game using Pygame. I had initially abandoned this project long ago but decided to revisit it.
                    I’m glad I did. It turned out to be much more enjoyable than expected, especially when experimenting with collisions, Sounds, Object Oriented Programming and More!

                    How it started: My first python game using PyGame. A simple Tic-tac-toe for two players (X and O). 
                    It includes a result menu with an option to play again. Hovering over the option highlights it, and clicking restarts the game. It push me to learn more.

                    How it started: The File Organizer project was initiated to address the chaos and disarray within my computer.
                    The primary goal of this project was to efficiently organize files by transforming the cluttered mess into a well-structured and easily navigable system.

                    I appreciate feedback as it enables me to enhance my work and avoid repeating the same mistakes. I’m optimistic about turning it into a complete app one day.

                    How it started: The calculator project began as an effort to enhance my initial project, 
                    which was a calculator without a graphical user interface (GUI) and solely relied on print statements.
                    I integrated tkinter to craft a more visually appealing interface. This project holds a special place 
                    for me as it not only improved my coding skills but also served as a foundation for experimenting with various functionalities.

                <p>
                    How it started: My digital clock project kicked off because I was really into trying different things,
                    that’s where tkinter came in. This project pushed me to improve my calculator project, 
                    making it more appealing to others. It taught me the basics of using tkinter to display things on the screen as an app.

                <p>
                    How it started: One of my first Java projects that I consider well done MineSweeper!
                    It took me a while to grasp the basics, but I managed to do it after several weeks of work. 
                    I love this project and had fun working on it. In the process of working on it, 
                    I had to learn how to play MineSweeper so I could debug the code well which is cool.
                    I want to revise and create an improved version of it in the future.
